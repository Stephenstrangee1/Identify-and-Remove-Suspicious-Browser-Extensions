 Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
=============================

Objective:
----------
Learned how to check, identify, and remove suspicious browser extensions
to improve browser security.

Steps Followed:
---------------
1. Opened Chrome Extensions page using chrome://extensions/
2. Reviewed all installed extensions.
3. Checked permissions and Chrome security warnings.
4. Identified "uTorrent for Chrome" as unsafe.
5. Removed the suspicious extension.
6. Restarted browser and verified functionality.

Findings:
---------
Installed Extensions (Before Cleanup):
  - Grammarly for Chrome      : Safe (Used for grammar checks)
  - Dark Reader               : Safe (Open-source, dark mode)
  - Adblock Plus              : Safe (Trusted ad blocker)
  - uTorrent for Chrome       : UNSAFE (Violated policy, flagged by Chrome)

Actions Taken:
--------------
  - Removed: uTorrent for Chrome
             Reason: Violates Chrome Web Store policy, requested excessive permissions
  - Kept   : Grammarly, Dark Reader, Adblock Plus

Installed Extensions (After Cleanup):
-------------------------------------
  - Grammarly for Chrome
  - Dark Reader
  - Adblock Plus

Key Learnings:
--------------
- Chrome automatically flags unsafe extensions like "uTorrent for Chrome".
- Such extensions can access sensitive user data and violate policy.
- Always check reviews, permissions, and publisher credibility.
- Removing unused/unsafe extensions improves browser security and performance.

Final Outcome:
--------------
Successfully identified and removed "uTorrent for Chrome".
Browser is now safe and optimized with trusted extensions only.
